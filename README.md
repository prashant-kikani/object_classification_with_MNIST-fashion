## Requirements
1. Tensorflow-gpu v1.3.0
2. Keras v2.1.3
3. Pandas
4. Numpy v1.14.0
5. sklearn v0.19.1
6. matplotlib
7. PIL (python image library) v4.2.1
8. OpenCV (cv2) v3.3.0


## Before usage
Neural network only give best results when we give similar images on which it is trained in testing phase.<br/> 
So, I am showing some images on which it is trained.<br/>
You should use this model with "<b>similar</b>" images. Not on completly different images.
